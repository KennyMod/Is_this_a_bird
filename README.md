# 🐦 Is it a Bird? – FastAI Lesson 1

This project is based on **Lesson 1** of the [FastAI Practical Deep Learning for Coders course](https://course.fast.ai/). It uses FastAI's high-level API to train a deep learning model that can identify whether an image contains a bird or not.

## 📌 Overview
- Built with FastAI and PyTorch
- Uses transfer learning with a pretrained ResNet model
- Trains on a small custom dataset of bird and non-bird images
- Includes image collection, model training, and inference steps

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- FastAI
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Kaggle (for GPU training)
- VS Code (for local editing)

## 🚀 Goal
To gain practical experience with:
- Image classification
- Model training and evaluation
- Using pre-trained models
- Deploying FastAI notebooks on different platforms

## 📝 Notes
- This notebook was initially developed and run on **Kaggle** with GPU support.
- It has been adapted for local editing and version control in **VS Code**.
